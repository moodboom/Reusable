Here you can find and create SIMPLE simple bits of scrap code.
Just open up scrap.cpp, add a new block of code, and try it out.
If the code gets big and hairy, move it out to a separate module.
CMake makes the build easy with Reusable and boost support.
But just use c++11 directly as need to keep these...

    AS SIMPLE AS SCRIPTS!  :-)
