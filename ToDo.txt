      COM NOTES
      ++++++++++

      
      CREATING A NEW PROJECT THAT INCLUDES COM INTERFACES
      ---------------------------------------------------
      
      1) COM projects don't seem to call the MIDL compiler properly by default!
        FUCKERS!  There should be an IDL file in your project dir.  Just run 
      
          MIDL <project>.idl
      
        from the root project dir and you should be fine.
      
        Can we add this to the project settings to do it right?!  There is a MIDL tab
        under settings.  No, this is just to set options for MIDL.

        It appears that MIDL is not set up properly on my machine.  The *.IDL file is included,
        but does not get compiled.  I am assuming that if things were set up properly, the 
        file would automatically get compiled with MIDL on project builds (when needed, of course).

      2) The NEXT problem is that App Wizard did not set up for the COM object to get
        automatically registered properly.  DOUBLE FUCKERS!
        Add the following to the Post-Build tab under project settings for all configurations:

          echo ------------------------------------------------
          echo Running: "$(TargetPath)" -RegServer
          "$(TargetPath)" -RegServer
          echo ------------------------------------------------
          echo Running: nmake -f "$(WkspName)ps.mk"
          nmake -f "$(WkspName)ps.mk"
          echo ------------------------------------------------
          echo Running: regsvr32.exe "$(WkspName)ps.dll"
          regsvr32.exe "$(WkspName)ps.dll"
          echo ------------------------------------------------

        Now evthing works COOLlike man!!

      3) Trouble again, unresolved external on some _proxy_xx() function...

        - MIDL creates the following files from an IDL: 

          If the attribute list contains the object keyword, the MIDL compiler generates COM interface 
          output files: 
            an interface proxy file, 
            an interface header file, 
            and a globally unique identifier (GUID) file for the interface. 
          If the IDL file contains a library statement, MIDL generates 
            a type library file with the .tlb file name extension
          If there are any interfaces in the IDL file that do not have the object keyword and 
          are not enclosed in a library statement, the MIDL compiler generates interface output files 
          appropriate for remote procedure calls (RPCs): 
            a client stub file, 
            a server stub file, 
            and a header file. 
          For more information, see the topic Interface Definitions and Type Libraries and Generating 
          a Type Library with MIDL in the MIDL Programmer's Guide and Language Reference in the Platform SDK. 

        - checked out the following to make them "writable": 
          LocalCache.tlb    
          LocalCache.IDL    
          LocalCacheps.mk  

        - MIDL generates dlldata.c, dlldata.obj on the fly.
          They were out-of-date or something - I deleted them, MIDL regenerated them, and we could build again.

        IF YOU EVER GET TROUBLE WITH DLLDATA FILES, it seems that just rerunning MIDL clears them up and
        refreshes things when u recompile.

      4) Fucking damned mofo'S!!!!  Editing the COM interface after it has been brittly created is a PITA!!
        Nice of them to make sure we fucking moron monkey idiots never drool on our keyboards and accidentally
        CHANGE a COM INTERFACE (certainly by ACCIDENT, otherwise it would certainly be a grevious blasphemy!!)
        a) First, update <projectname>.idl with the new interface changes.
          You can do this nicely by selecting the interface in the classes browser, and right clicking 
          on the target interface and selecting "Add method".
          Rerun MIDL [ MIDL <projname>.idl ].
          Recompile.
          IF you have trouble after running MIDL and recompiling...
        b)  Try cleaning up the following before re-running MIDL:
          dlldata.*        temp files generated by MIDL
          <projectname>_i.c    contains "IIDs and CLSIDs"
          <projectname>_p.c    "proxy code"
          <projectname>.tlb    binary
          <projectname>.h    always generated(!) "interface definition"
          <projectname>ps.*    WHO THE FUCK KNOWS!?!  Rrrr.... Lack of decent COM support from MS is reaaaally pissin me off...
        c) Also, make sure that the following are writable:
          LocalCache.tlb
          LocalCache.IDL
          LocalCacheps.mk
        d) Rerun MIDL, recompile, and PRAY REAL HARD.

      TO ACTUALLY USE THE COM OBJECT IN ANOTHER PROJECT
      -------------------------------------------------

        Obviously, you don't want to have to include the source code in the other project.
        But you must include the entire INTERFACE DEFINITION!
        This is accomplished via the "#import" directive!!!
        E.g.: 
          #import "..\LocalCache.tlb" no_namespace named_guids raw_interfaces_only
        imports the LocalCache COM object, defining the CLSID that you will need in the
        call to CoCreateInstanceEx(), and also completely defining the interface so you
        can actually USE it!

      MOTHA FUCKA'S!!  
      FIX: ATL Service EXE Doesn't Build in Release Build 
      ID: Q167946 
      ---------------------------------------------------------
      To get release builds to work (even in VC++ 6.0 despite what ID: Q167946 says), you have to
      remove _ATL_MIN_CRT from the list the preprocessor defines, under ProjectSettings:C++:General:Preproc.Def's


      MAINTENANCE
      -----------
      If you manually change a COM interface (by changing the *.IDL and matching COM *.cpp and *.h file), you
      will need to rerun MIDL, which will update a whole mess a' files...

      THREAD RULES
      ============
      1) You have to choose support for either CRT (C Runtime Library) 
        functions, or MFC functions.
      
          a) CRT: always use _beginthread(), you cannot use MFC functions
      
          b) MFC: always use CreateThread(), you cannot use CRT functions
      
        MY ADVICE: ALWAYS USE (a) TO AVOID TROUBLE!  No CRT support
        sounds crazy to me.
      
      2) Communication across threads can use variables local to the
        process.  Watch out for vars that go out of scope!  You can use 
        statics, which you know will stick around as long
        as the process does, but then you have to make sure access
        to them is thread-safe.

      3) Communicate across non-distributed processes with standard
        Windows messages passed to HWND's, or switch up to COM.
      
      4) For distributed processes, switch to COM (actually DCOM, which
        is the same thing to you the programmer).

      Reusable Code concept:
        95% of code is production quality that can be dropped in "as-is"
        if I have to put in a 5% effort to tie the code in, there is a 20x's return on investment!
        I spent a LOT of my time expanding and improving the reusable code base - these changes
          get rolled in "for free"
        I grant ABB rights to do whatever it wants with the code, for any purpose
        The whole goal is to complete ABB's goals as quickly and efficiently as possible

// MDM  5/28/01 11:18:58 AM
      List control external data fix:
        
        Use a define ( MCSLC_USE_EXTERNAL_DATA ) in MCSLC.
        If the user of the class defines it, MCSLC should use EDLC as base, not CListCtrl.
        Also wrap all other dependent code.

        Derived classes can set the define on an as-needed basis.

        NOPE, this will NOT allow us to use BOTH types in the same place (*.obj names will conflict, for one).

        The best solution:
          Remove EDLC from the list control chain, and multi-inherit as needed in derived classes?
            No, because MCSLC needs to know, and work with, EDLC support.

          KEEP THE BOOL!

      HOW DO I ADD ANOTHER LANGUAGE TO THE RESOURCE EDITOR!?!?!
        
        Internationalization of the OS (here, by adding SWEDISH)
        --------------------------------------------------------
        Install IE 5.5 (also installed NT 4 SP6a)
        Install language packs during install or from www.microsoft.com/windowsupdate
        IE:Tools:Internet Options:General:Languages:Swedish
        Control Panel:Regional Settings:Input Locals: Add Swedish

        Adding language-specific resources
        ----------------------------------
        Select resource (string table, dialog template, etc.)
        Select "Insert copy..." from right-click or main menu.
        Set language of new copy.

      NOTE on STL and red-black trees...
      The C++ standard template library (STL) introduces the  
      associative containers set, multiset, map, and multimap, which are  
      based on red-black trees. 

      Bjarne sample code (check out for_each - part of STL?):

      1)  void draw_all(list& lst)
        {
        for_each(lst.begin(),lst.end(),mem_fun(&Shape::draw));
        }

      2)  Incidentally, your example "function of T returning a bool" is often best represented as a function 
        object. And function objects are natural templates: 

          template< class T > 
          struct Predicate {
          bool operator()(const T &r) { /* ... */ };
          }; 

        This way, you don't need a typedef; you can simply say: 

        Predicate* p;

        Function objects also inline better than pointers to functions, so their use leads to faster code as well as cleaner code. 

        In general, I recommend "The Design and Evolution of C++" for people with "why is/isn't it like that in C++?" questions. 

      3)  Learning Standard C++ as a New Language
        http://www.research.att.com/~bs/papers.html

        The C++ Programming Language (Special Edition)
        http://www.research.att.com/~bs/3rd.html

        The Design and Evolution of C++
        http://www.research.att.com/~bs/dne.html

      4) MI examples:
      
          class network_file_error : public network_error,
          public file_error {
          // ...
          };

        and

          class interface { // abstract class
          // pure virtual functions
          }; 
          class base_implementation { // useful functionality
          // data, functions, virtual functions
          };

          class my_implementation
          : public interface,
          protected base_implementation {
          // data, functions
          // override some base_implementation functions
          // override all interface functions
          }; 

        You then have the users of my_implementation access it exclusively through pointers or references 
        to interface. That was user code is independent on the implementation class and the system doesn'
        t suffer from the so-called "brittle base class" problem. The implementation class can be exchanged for 
        an improved version without recompilation of user code (except my_implementation itself). 

        Following those two styles avoids most problems. Naturally, you can find a more extensive discussion 
        in "The C++ Programming Language (3rd Edition)" and in the new "The C++ Programming Language 
        (Special Edition)." (See my home pages for details, sample chapters, reviews, etc.). 

      5)  If you focus on defining concrete classes to represent simple types and abstract classes to represent 
        major interfaces, a good design is likely to emerge. Then, MI may or may not be needed to complete the 
        program, but will be pretty obvious where it might be needed. 

      6) Reference counting can be very useful for less frequently used resources, but I'm not advocating it 
        as a general mechanism for keeping track of memory. C++ has good mechanisms for keeping memory management 
        under control (such as constructors and destructors and the standard library containers), but if you need 
        something more automatics, plugging in one of the available garbage collectors is the right answer (see 
        section C.9.1 of "The C++ Programming language", my C++ page, or my FAQ). 

      ALso an interview with A. Stepanov
        http://www.stlport.org/resources/StepanovUSA.html

        Question:
        I find two hash table implementations in the D.Musser site, and they were both working and quite smart 
        - much smarter than hash tables commonly found in class libraries. Why were hash tables not included 
        into STL? 

        Answer:
        Politics. They have to be in. Our new implementation of STL does contain them. In general, we need to 
        develop a mechanism for adding things to STL. After all, STL is an extensible framework, it begs to 
        be extended. There are many data structures that are missing, for example, singly linked lists, 
        matrices, and graphs. SGI is willing to lead the way in extending STL. 

      An older one with Al Stevens...
        http://www.sgi.com/tech/stl/drdobbs-interview.html

        Q: Set, multiset, map, and multimap are implemented with a red-black tree data structure. Have you 
        experimented with other structures such as B*trees? 

        A: I don't think that would be quite right for in-memory data structures, but this is something that 
        needs to be done. The same interfaces defined by STL need to be implemented with other data structures
        ---skip lists, splay trees, half-balanced trees, and so on. It's a major research activity that needs 
        to be done because STL provides us with a framework where we can compare the performance of these 
        structures. The interface is fixed. The basic complexity requirements are fixed. Now we can have 
        meaningful experiments comparing different data structures to each other. There were a lot of people 
        from the data structure community coming up with all kinds of data structures for that kind of 
        interface. I hope that they would implement them as generic data structures within the STL framework.
