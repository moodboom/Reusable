# Reusable
My reusable code, a bucket of bolts that has helped me get my projects done.

Primary assets include:

* "SCRAP" projects for several programming languages; these attempt to provide clean simple examples of language features; Javascript Node and C++ are featured
* utilites.cpp/hpp helpers that leverage C++20, boost, and two JSON libs (boost::json AND nlohmann::json)
* C++ HttpApiServer on top of Ole Christian EidHeim's Simple-Web[Socket]-Server
* sorted_vector C++ class
