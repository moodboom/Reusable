Four ways (or more!) to run:

   vscode: 
      open folder /home/m/development/Reusable/JavaScript/scrap/readme.txt
      use run/debug
      (see launch.json to add more scrap files)

   ./file.js         # it has a shebang and node will just run it
   node file.js      # manual
                     # paste code into browser console
   # node [ENTER}    # to enter REPL, then paste code
