A ton of ways to run the scrap modules:

   1 vscode: 
      open this folder /home/m/development/Reusable/JavaScript/scrap
      select the scrap to run, from the Run and Debug page dropdown
      Press the green arrow (or hit your Run key, mine is F6)
      (see launch.json to add more scrap files)

   2 ./file.js         # it has a shebang and node will just run it
   3 node file.js      # manual
   4 browser           # copy and paste scrap code into browser console
   5 # node [ENTER}    # to enter REPL, then paste code
